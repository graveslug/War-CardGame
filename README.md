# War-CardGame

Technologies used:
Javascript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.


In this particular project I kept the focus on a functional programming style as it made the most sense for what I was seeking to achieve with this particular project. That is to manipulate the array and see what I could do with it.
Another reason I chose functional programming was that it made things easier in tracking down bugs and keeping my code simple and easy to read.

Unsolved: Flipping card animations. I spent two days trying to connect it all before scrapping the idea and doing something simpler in favor of spending more time inside Javascript.
Otherwise no unresolved issues. Everything on face value is functioning fine.

Future updates: multiple decks, added suits, some sorting animations of the cards to show an insertion sort with their numbers on them. A themeSwitcher to something cool, and  implement into the WAR event to have multiple cards in play instead of just one extra.

If I kept to my Necromancer's War theme I would animate the skeletons heads more and have little skeletons fighting in between. The words would be placed on an artful scroll to the side that tracks all dialogue.

Overall I'm content with the project and look forward to the next. I achieved what I had set out to do and done just that.


struggles: In particular would've been getting the playGame and checkWin functions to work and behave correctly. Starting the game and ending the game seemed to be the roadblocks for me.
